<p> India can expect to receive stocks of Sputnik V at some point between later this month and June, as Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) begins importing consignments of the Russian-made vaccine against Covid-19.

The availability of the vaccine in India will, however, depend ultimately on factors such as the number of doses that the government wishes to procure, the price, and the capacity of the country’s cold chain system to distribute the vaccine.

As part of its contract with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), DRL is expected to receive around 250 million doses of Spuntik V, Deepak Sapra, the company’s CEO, API and Services, said on Wednesday. Sputnik V being a double-dose vaccine, this would be sufficient for 125 million people, but DRL can procure more doses from RDIF for India with “mutual consent”.While discussions continue with the government over the use of Sputnik V in India’s immunization campaign, the company will start imports “this quarter”, Sapra said.DRL said it could not comment or speculate on the price of the vaccine at this stage. Clarity on price and the number of doses that India will use will emerge “in the next few weeks”, company executives said.

While reports had suggested earlier that negotiations were on to price the vaccine at $3 (around Rs 225.50) a dose, Sapra said on Wednesday that “this point is still under discussion in terms of the number of doses the government could buy and at what price it could buy”.

“We are working with them to determine the quantities (and) the place where it will go. The priorities of the government and the discussions we will have with them and the other stakeholders will determine where all Sputnik is distributed,” he said. “The objective is that, over a period of time, we will have enough vaccines to be made available throughout the country.”</p>
